## How to Download
You can grab the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/birajrai/MyAuth/releases) page. Just drop the downloaded file into your mods folder.

Alternatively, if you're concerned about security or want more control, feel free to compile the mod yourself.

## Key Features
- **Session ID Login**: Easily log in to another account with just a Session ID.
- **Session Restoration**: Quickly revert back to your original session whenever you want.
- **Session Validation**: Check if a Session ID is valid and see if the account is online on Hypixel (doesn't work if Pizza Client session protection is active).
- **Error Handling**: Built-in protection against invalid input errors.
- **Username Control**: Safely change the username for the current session, with safeguards to protect your main account.
- **Custom Skins**: Update the account's skin using any image URL (e.g., use a direct URL to switch to a Steve skin).
- **User-Friendly**: Straightforward and easy to use interface for all features.
